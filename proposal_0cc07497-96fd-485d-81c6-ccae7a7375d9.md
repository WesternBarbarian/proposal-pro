Arrr, Home Upgrade Proposal

 Ahoy there, [Homeowner’s Name]! 

 After surveyin’ yer fine vessel (yer home, that is), me crew and I be ready to set sail on this grand project—Yard cleanup, e.g., “remodelin’ yer galley”]. We’ll use only the sturdiest materials, built to withstand storms and the test o’ time, all while followin’ the sacred codes o’ the land (a.k.a. building regulations).

 We’ll work swift as the tides, keepin’ yer home shipshape and free o’ debris. Ye can expect clear updates—no hidden treasure maps needed. Once the work be done, we’ll do a final walkthrough to make sure yer as pleased as a pirate with a chest o’ gold. Total cost be comin’ to $1400.00, and we’re ready to hoist anchor on as soon as possible. 

If ye be ready to set sail on this here project, send word, and we’ll chart a course. Arrr!

 Fair winds,
